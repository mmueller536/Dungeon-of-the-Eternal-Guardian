# Dungeon of the Eternal Guardian
## A CS220 Project

A semester long project conducted by Michael Mueller and Paul Coen. Together they built and implemented a simple dungeon crawler game from scratch utilizing the classic concept of raycasting to create a pseudo 3D environment. The project incorporated not only raycast however. The project also ultilizes a multitude of data strutures like linked list, tree, and more as the incorporation of these structures was the ultimate goal of the class.

To demo this project, simply download the project and simply run the jar file included in the download.
